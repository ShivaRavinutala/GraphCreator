Specifications

Using Flutter, I have to create a web application that takes in a range of values that can be graphable and then draws a graphical representation on what was given as input. 

Input

The input is a CSV file that is the dataset that this program is going to be reading. In addition, this program will take in a range. This can be a time period, values only from a certain range, or even more. This will also include subsets in the dataset provided. For example, if the user wants to see a graph of values from a certain period of time from a column in the graph, this should be possible with my program. 

A dropdown should be created after the user provides the range. If the columns in the given dataset were “Distance A”, “Distance B”, “Distance C”, and “Distance D”, then the user should be able to see all of these as options in the dropdown menu. This will be created accordingly for the X and Y axes. These dropdowns should allow for multi select for each of the axes. In addition, 2 text boxes should be created for each of the inputs provided so that the user can specify the range of values they want to see. 




Output

The output will be a graphical representation of whatever has been provided as input. Given the dataset and the column it should read from and the time period or values, a graph should be created from the values that were given. 

If the user provides more than one X or Y inputs, then the output should be 4 different graphs combined into one. Each of these should be in a different color with labels.
